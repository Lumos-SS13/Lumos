			<b><i>FISHING MANUAL</i></b><br>
			--------------------<br>
			Hello new fishers, and welcome to the manual to help you understand how to farm fish.<br>
			The first step is to start building the tank. Take ten metal and build a fish tank frame.<br>
			After you have built the frame, take five glass and add it to the frame, and voila, you have a fish tank!<br>
			--------------------<br>
			In this crate, there should be some salmon fish boxes. Open them up to get two of each salmon.<br>
			Be careful, as only males and females can breed, and you MIGHT get two males or two females from a box!<br>
			Place the male and female in the tank and let them do their thing.<br>
			Over time, they will age and produce less and less eggs until they die.<br>
			<br>
			But how do you check their age...<br>
			--------------------<br>
			Go to your service protolathe.<br>
			Once science researches basic tools, you should have access to printing your four basic tools:<br>
			1) Fish Brush - Used to clean the fish tank. Dirty tanks hurt the fish!<br>
			2) Fish Clipper - Used to cut the seaweed growing in the tanks... use that seaweed for some food.<br>
			3) Fish Egg Neutralizer - Used to kill fish eggs so you can use them for food.<br>
			4) Fish Analyzer - Used on the tanks or the fish to analyze their health, hunger, age, etc.<br>
			<br>
			So that is the tools you can get, but I never explained the eggs, did I?<br>
			--------------------<br>
			So fish eggs... if they are not euthanized, they will spawn their adult forms after two minutes.<br>
			At birth is the sex designated for the fishes. Fish eggs also taste pretty good.<br>
			<br>
			with much love,<br>
