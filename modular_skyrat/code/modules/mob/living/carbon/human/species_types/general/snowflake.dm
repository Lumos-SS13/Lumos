The changes resulting from this fusion often times leave no trace of the victims original biology or species, turning them into an entirely plasma-based lifeform.

Originally made for planets with extreme gravity, Dwarves are much more bulky and short in their physiology; along with various other changes, the most unusual outcome was their biological dependence on alcohol to survive. If a Dwarf goes too long without alcohol, they will suffer similar effects to extreme dehydration in humans, eventually culminating in death."

Hosts are extremely aggressive on account of neurological changes imposed by the nanomachines, driven to spread their affliction to anyone who isn't infected. While sapient zombies do exist, able to regulate their nanomachines to be nonlethal and overall benign, they still suffer heavy prejudice on account of their origin."
